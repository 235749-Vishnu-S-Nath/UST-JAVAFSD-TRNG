8) ForEach()
9) Collectors Class
10) JDBC enhancement etc...


LAMBDA EXPRESSION:
..................
Lambda exp was introduced to favour the functional interface and method referances. It looks like as though it's a functional code.
A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value.
Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.
Lambda expression contains mainly 3 sections.
  a) () : Paramaters..(Which can be empty or null)
  b) -> : Lambda Expression symbol
  c) () : Body


Functional Interface:
.....................
Functional interface are the interface which exactly has only ONE ABSTRACT METHOD.


Method Reference:
.................
Method reference is used to point/refer to the functional interface method.
Types of Method Reference:
  a) Reference to a Static method.
  b) Reference to a Instance method.
  c) Reference to a Constructor.


Optional:
.........
Optional is a class newly introduced as a part of java 8. It is used to deal with NullPointerException.


Default and Static Methods:
...........................
In older Java interface we cannot declare a function which cannot be defined in the implemented class.
As a part of Java 8, In functional interface we can implement Default and Static method in it, which can be later overriden.


Stream API:
...........
Streaming: it is transfer of data from source to destination with out being modified or persisted.
